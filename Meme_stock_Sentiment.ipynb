        "Social media investment communities are having an appreciable effect on stock prices.  In this project, text analysis of Twitter, Reddit, and other social media post data is used to determine the stocks which are most frequently mentioned.  A polarity score assigned to each post using sentiment analysis is used to create a regression model to predict stock price.  \n",

        "Post data will be scrapped or downloaded from several social media groups or platforms with active investment communities (Twitter, Reddit, Discord, etc.).  Various natural language processing (NLP) packages will be tested to create a polarity time-series graph.  These packages may include NLTK, TextBlob, Syuzhet, Polyglot, CoreNLP, Gensim, and skLearn.  The package that produces a polarity curve most closely aligned to the daily stock price will be selected to generate post polarity scores.  To improve polarity score accuracy, a custom dictionary with investor-specific terms will be created.  A regression model (regressing polarity scores on stock price) will be used to predict the meme-stock’s price.  The model will be trained on previous meme stocks using 70-80% of post data.  The remaining data will be reserved to test the model.  Previous meme stocks used in this project will include but not be limited to GameStop, AMC, BlackBerry, TillRay, and Hertz.  We will consider other models such as SVM if linear regression does not prove accurate.\n",
